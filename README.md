There is several puprposes for this challenge; For this analysis we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting. Also this analisys helps Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases, Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). all of this allowed us to Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
