# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

There is several puprposes for this challenge; For this analysis we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. Also this analisys helps Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases, Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
All of the above allowed us to Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Results.

After scrolling down through the website, to the right of the screen we are able to see the UFO sightings data, and to the left of the screen we are able to see the filter options, where we can filter by different categories.

### Filtering for Oregon State:

After situating ourselves in the filter section, we have selected a category to be filtered on, as you can see we have selected OREGON under State option.
We can see that the website is fully functional since is displaying the right information.

## Summary.


### Drawback:

The Drawback I was able to determine is that the user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "elcajon", “el cajon_”, or "El Cajon". The only acceptable input would be "el cajon".

### Recommendations:

1. to have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site, also add to the filter a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases.
2. 
3. adding another filter to date range might be preferable than a singular date.
